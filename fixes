Fixes applied to cto-frontend-old-fresh

1) Privy payment endpoints were missing JWT
What was wrong
- Backend requires JwtAuthGuard for Privy payment routes, but the test frontend did not send Authorization headers.
- Calls failed with 401 even after successful login.

What I changed (test frontend)
- File: cto-frontend-old-fresh/src/services/privyPaymentService.ts
- Added reading cto_auth_token from localStorage.
- Added Authorization: Bearer <token> headers to:
  - POST /api/v1/payment/privy/listing
  - POST /api/v1/payment/privy/verify/:paymentId
- Throws a clear error if token is missing.

How to implement the same fix in main-cto-frontend
- File: main-cto-frontend/src/services/privyPaymentService.ts
- Add the same Authorization header logic using cto_auth_token.
- Keep existing API paths (main frontend uses /api/payment/privy/...)

Reference snippet (logic only):
const token = localStorage.getItem('cto_auth_token');
if (!token) throw new Error('No authentication token');
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
}

2) Privy payment moved to legacy and removed from UI
What was changed
- File moved: cto-frontend-old-fresh/src/services/privyPaymentService.ts -> cto-frontend-old-fresh/src/legacy/privyPaymentService.ts
- File updated: cto-frontend-old-fresh/src/components/Payment/ListingPayment.tsx
  - Removed Privy EVM + Circle payment paths and UI selector.
  - Movement payment is now the only active flow in the UI.
  - Manual verify uses Movement payment verify with the saved txHash.

How to implement the same in main-cto-frontend
- Move or archive the Privy EVM/Circle payment UI so only Movement is selectable.
- Keep any legacy payment service in a legacy folder if needed for reference.

3) Movement-only pricing in test frontend (remove Circle pricing fetch)
What was changed
- File moved to legacy: cto-frontend-old-fresh/src/services/paymentService.ts -> cto-frontend-old-fresh/src/legacy/paymentService.ts
- File updated: cto-frontend-old-fresh/src/components/UserListings/MyUserListings.tsx
  - Removed pricing fetch from /api/v1/payment/pricing
  - Removed listingPrice state (now fixed to 1.0 USDC in UI text)

How to implement the same in main-cto-frontend
- Remove calls to /api/payment/pricing (Circle pricing) from My Listings UI.
- Hardcode 1.0 USDC display (or read Movement listing amount from backend if you add an endpoint).

Backend note (for backend devs)
- Privy/Circle payment controllers/services moved to legacy and removed from PaymentModule.
- Active payments are Movement-only now.

4) Presentable listings rotation removed (manual curation only)
What was changed
- File: cto-backend-old-fresh/src/listing/workers/refresh.worker.ts
  - Removed disabled dailyRotation() method (was commented out with @Cron disabled)
  - Removed disabled enforceTokenLimitRotation() method
  - Updated comments to clarify: "Tokens are manually managed via POST /api/listing/add"
  - No automatic deletion or rotation - all tokens are manually curated

Current behavior
- Tokens are added manually via POST /api/listing/add endpoint
- No automatic daily rotation or token limit enforcement
- Manual curation model (as per user requirement)

Documentation
- Any docs mentioning "25 tokens, daily rotation" should be updated to reflect manual curation model
